        <p class="review"><em>A typical episode is a series of competitive games of dares in which each cast member, or "joker", receives either a thumbs up or thumbs down for his performance. At the end of the episode, the joker who has received the most thumbs down is the loser and must undergo a "punishment," usually involving public embarrassment. The games are contrived scenarios in which one joker is challenged to embarrass himself by engaging with unwitting members of the general public, receiving commands from the other jokers who are orchestrating and surveying the bizarre scenario from behind the scenes with covert surveillance equipment. <br> As you can tell, this is not a review but a description. Thanks for your attention btw!</em></p>
